# Tessellate Test-Time Scaling: Critical Implementation Details

## Core Value Proposition
Tessellate's multiplicative scoring creates explosive value changes that require deep search. This makes it ideal for demonstrating test-time compute scaling - the AI must evaluate compound effects of moves many steps ahead.

## Technical Architecture

### Model: Deep Thinking with Recall
- **Architecture**: ResNet-style recurrent blocks with recall mechanism (concatenate board state at each iteration)
- **Why Recall**: Prevents feature degradation over 1000+ iterations, ensures convergence
- **Training**: Progressive loss with α=0.01 for stability

### Compute Scaling Demonstration
1. **Quick** (10 iterations): Sees immediate connections only
2. **Balanced** (50 iterations): Evaluates 2-3 move sequences
3. **Deep** (200+ iterations): Discovers compound strategies, multi-island planning

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Model Architecture (from Chapter 5)
```python
# Recall mechanism - the key to scaling
def recurrent_block_with_recall(features, board_state):
    combined = concat([features, board_state])
    return residual_block(combined)

# Training: Progressive loss prevents overthinking
n = random.randint(0, max_iters-1)  # Start from random iteration
k = random.randint(1, max_iters-n)  # Continue for k steps
partial_features = model.forward(board, n, no_grad=True)
output = model.forward_from(partial_features, k)
loss = alpha * progressive_loss + (1-alpha) * standard_loss
```

#### Why This Works for Tessellate
- **Multiplicative scoring**: Small decisions compound exponentially
- **Island merging**: Requires evaluating sequences 5+ moves ahead
- **Fixed board size**: 5x5 grid is complex enough to show scaling, simple enough to converge

## The Convergence Property (Critical for Success)

### What Makes Our Model Special
```python
# Measure convergence: Δφ should decrease
delta_phi = torch.norm(features[i] - features[i-1])
# Good models: delta_phi → 0 as iterations increase
# Bad models: delta_phi explodes (overthinking)
```

### Visual Proof of Concept
- Iteration 1-20: Large Δφ (exploring possibilities)
- Iteration 20-50: Medium Δφ (refining strategy)  
- Iteration 50+: Small Δφ (converged to solution)

This convergence property means:
1. No need for halting mechanisms
2. Can safely run 1000+ iterations
3. Solution quality monotonically improves

## Educational Framing for NeurIPS

### The Single Key Insight
In closed domains like games, AI performance scales with inference-time compute. This is fundamentally different from human thinking - we don't get better at chess by thinking 10x longer on each move.

### What Users Will See
1. **Same AI, Different Speeds**: One model, three compute budgets
2. **The Thinking Process**: Move evaluations evolving in real-time
3. **Critical Moments**: AI automatically thinks longer at complex positions
4. **The Plateau**: Eventually more compute doesn't help (convergence)

### What This Teaches
- **Success**: Test-time scaling works when the problem space is bounded
- **Limitation**: This doesn't create understanding or generalization
- **Insight**: The difference between search (what AI does) and reasoning (what humans do)

## Minimal Viable Implementation

### Must Have
1. Pre-trained model with verified scaling behavior
2. Three clear compute levels with measurable performance differences
3. Visual indicator of thinking progress
4. Win rate comparison chart

### Can Skip
- Complex visualizations of internal features
- Multiple board sizes
- Training interface
- Detailed technical explanations

### Files to Create
```python
# tessellate_scaled_ai.py
class TessellateScaledAI:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_path):
        self.model = load_recall_model(checkpoint_path)
    
    def get_move(self, board, iterations):
        features = self.model.embed(board)
        for i in range(iterations):
            features = self.model.recurrent_block(features, board)
            if i % 10 == 0:
                yield self.model.decode(features)  # Stream progress
        return self.model.decode(features)
```

## Success Metrics
1. **Technical**: Model achieves >80% win rate at 200 iterations vs 50% at 10 iterations
2. **Educational**: Users understand that more compute = better performance in closed domains
3. **Clarity**: Non-experts grasp the concept without ML background
