## Game Rules

Tessellate is played on a 10Ã—10 grid where:
- Players take turns placing right triangular tiles in square cells
- Tiles of the same color form islands when connected by edges
- Score = product (multiplication) of all your island sizes
- Highest score wins after all the squares are filled
